## A designer among thousands of developers...

Hey! 👋 I'm an enthusiastic Product Designer, interested in web development, and love collaborating on open-source projects.
Currently, I'm working on the [Organized app](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app)), which helps congregations save hundreds of hours and get rid of tons of stress.
