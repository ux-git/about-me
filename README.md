#A designer among thousands of developers...

Hey! 👋 I'm an enthusiastic Product Designer, interested in web development, and love collaborating on open-source projects.
Currently, I'm working on the [Organized app]([url](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app)), which helps congregations save hundreds of hours and get rid of tons of stress.

## About me

🎨 Product Designer with 6 years of experience.
💡 Always learning new skills and exploring new tech.
🌐 Happy to collaborate with developers on impactful projects!

## Current project: Organized App

🚀 I'm actively contributing to the design and development of the Organized app – a tool designed to assist everyone in Jehovah’s Witnesses congregations. [Check it out](https://github.com/sws2apps/organized-app). That's the repository where you can find and contact me.
